## About Me


Hi! I'm currently a senior at University of Houston majoring in Computer Science and Math with a concentration in Data Science. My research interests are natural language processing and artificial intelligence. I work under Professor [Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) at the [RiTUAL](https://ritual.uh.edu/) (Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language) lab.
